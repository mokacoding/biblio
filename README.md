# üìöBiblio - Discover new books

Biblio is the project name for book browser app fetching the [New York Times best sellers list](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/).

It serves as the playground for the "Refactoring Horrible Codebases Driven By Tests" workshop.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Intenionally Horrible ‚ö†Ô∏è

The code is **intentionally horrible**. Bloated view controllers, singletons, components doing more than one job... Don't take this code as an example of how to write a good app.

## Development

To get started clone the repo and run the `bootstrap` script.

```
git clone git@github.com:mokacoding/biblio && cd biblio
./bin/bootstrap
```
